            <p><img id="me" src="/media/images/me.jpg" width="200" /> I'm a Full Stack Web Developer trying to put my skills and knowledge to good use and make a difference in this crazy world.  Currently employed full-time with <a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/" title="National Priorities Project">National Priorities Project</a> but on the search for a new challenge.  If you have a job available with a technically and socially innovative company, please check out my <a href="/resume.html" title="Resume">resume</a> and feel free to get in touch.</p>

            <p>I currently reside in <a href="http://www.northamptonma.gov/" title="Northampton, MA">Northampton, MA</a> where I own a small home with my beautiful <a href="http://harvestmoonblog.tumblr.com/" title="Harvest Moon Blog">wife</a>, our wonderful 11 month old baby boy <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4ufu4OBc01rrngsjo1_500.jpg">Lucas</a>, and our 3 year old <a href="/media/images/omar.jpg" title="Black Lab">Black Lab</a>.</p>

            <p>My limited free time these days tends to include but is in no way limited to: DIY home improvement and car repairs, motorcyles, gardening, hiking, photography and music.</p>

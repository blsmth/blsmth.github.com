        <div class="span12 offset2" id="about-me">
            <p><img id="me" src="/media/images/me.jpg" width="200" /> I'm a Full Stack Web Developer trying to put my skills and knowledge to good use.  I call myself a Full Stack Web Developer because I can handle the entire stack - from the back-end to front-end to deployment.  I love Python/Django and I've spent many years using PHP.   Recently heavy into Javascript (who isn't?) and loving it.</p>

            <p>I have been employed full time for over 4 years now at <a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/" title="National Priorities Project">National Priorities Project</a> and decided it was time to move on.  Starting two weeks I will be going to work as the newest Software Engineer with the team behind <a href="http://custommade.com" title="Custom Made">CustomMade.com</a>.  I'm really looking forward to this opportunity as it seems to be a fantastic place to work with a really great mission - bringing local artisans making custom made goods of all sorts into the spotlight as a direct alternative to buying cheap goods from big box stores.</p>

            <p>I currently reside in <a href="http://www.northamptonma.gov/" title="Northampton, MA">Northampton, MA</a> where I own a small home with my beautiful <a href="http://harvestmoonblog.tumblr.com/" title="Harvest Moon Blog">wife</a>, our wonderful 1 year (almost!) old baby boy <a href="/photos/#album/lucas">Lucas</a>, and our 3 year old <a href="/media/images/omar.jpg" title="Black Lab">Black Lab</a>.</p>

            <p>My limited free time these days tends to include but is in no way limited to: DIY home improvement and car repairs, motorcyles, gardening, hiking, photography and music.</p>

            <p>And since it seems you can't leave it out these days - my beer of choice is anything from <a href="http://victorybeer.com/" title="Victory Brewing">Victory Brewing</a>, especially <a href="http://victorybeer.com/beers/hopdevil/" title="Hop Devil">Hop Devil</a>.</p>

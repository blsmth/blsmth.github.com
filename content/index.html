        <p>Brendan Smith, Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
        <p>I love Python + Django but can handle it all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Found a new challenge!</p>
        <p>Starting in two weeks I will be going to work as the newest Software Engineer with the team behind <a href="http://custommade.com" title="Custom Made">CustomMade.com</a>.  I'm really looking forward to this opportunity as it seems to be a fantastic place to work with a really great mission - bringing local artisans making custom made goods of all sorts into the spotlight as a direct alternative to buying cheap goods from big box stores.</p>
